Ever wonder why, when writing your own WP-CLI command, you had to extend `WP_CLI_Command`? Well, you didn't need to, actually.

### A more RESTful WP-CLI


### Everything else in 0.23.0

Command improvements:

* Better performance for `wp (user|post) list --format=count` by only fetching the data we need [[#2370](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/pull/2370),[#2387](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/pull/2387)].
* Prevents dupe builds with Travis default settings in `wp scaffold plugin-tests` [[#2377](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/pull/2377)].
* Generate comments for a specific post with `wp comment generate --post_id=<post-id>` [[#2388](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/pull/2388)].
* Cleans up files from the prior version when using `wp core (update|download) --force` [[#2382](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/pull/2382),[#2406](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/pull/2406),[#2413](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/pull/2413),[#2432](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/pull/2432)].
* Adds a timer to individual events in `wp cron event run` [[#2437](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/pull/2437)].
* Introduces `wp term meta` for managing term meta [[#2444](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/pull/2444)].
* Adds CSV and JSON output format to `wp (theme|plugin) update` [[#2452](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/pull/2452)].
* Verifies MD5 hash of downloaded archive file with `wp core download` [[#2461](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/pull/2461)]
* Entirely avoids loading WordPress in `wp core verify-checksums` [[#2459](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/pull/2459)].
* Supports emptying term meta with `wp site empty` [[#2506](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/pull/2506)].
* Adds WP REST API registration args to `scaffold (post-type|taxonomy)` [[#2551](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/pull/2551)].

Framework enhancements:

* Switches `WP_CLI::confirm()` to automatically lowercase the response, permitting use of `Y` or `y` [[2366](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/pull/2366)].
* Adds `(before|after)_wp(_config)_load` hooks in WP load process, permitting code injected via `--require` to make modifications during the bootstrap process [[#2375](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/pull/2375)].
* Adds `.editorconfig` to project root based on WordPress Coding Standards [[#2395](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/pull/2395)].
* Encodes `WP_Error` data as JSON in `WP_CLI::error_to_string()` so that the data is actually human-readable [[#2397](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/pull/2397)].
* Supports custom exit codes in `WP_CLI::error()` [[#2440](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/pull/2440)].
* Introduces `--format=yaml` for easily displaying data as YAML [[#2453](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/pull/2453)].
* Supports config deep merging and inheritance [[#2496](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/pull/2496)].
* Updates Composer dependencies [[#2554](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/pull/2554)]

Bug fixes across the board:

* In `bin/install-wp-tests.sh`, don't cd in `WP_TESTS_DIR` before dowloading and setting up `wp-tests-config.php` [[#2371](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/pull/2371)].
* When using `--prompt`, now only prompts for the first command in the execution thread. Previously, any use of `WP_CLI::run_command()` within a command would cause the prompting UX to appear again [[#2400](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/pull/2400)].
* Removes unnecessary `exit` on premature success for `wp theme activate` [[#2412](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/pull/2412)].
* Checks if a taxonomy exists before listing its terms [[#2414](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/pull/2414)].
* When trying to update a version of core that doesn't exist, check the HTTP response code before trying to unzip an invalid archive [[#2368](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/pull/2368)].
* Fixes use of `wp server` when the PHP binary contains spaces [[#2422](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/pull/2422)].
* Respects `--skip_comments` flag for `wp export`, which has been broken for quite a while [[#2427](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/pull/2427)]
* Persists IPTC data in `wp media import` when missing a title or caption; removes extension from default title [[#2438](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/pull/2438),[#2466](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/pull/2466)].
* Disables check translation updates when updating themes or plugins [[#2439](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/pull/2439)].
* Corrects parameter sequence order when creating a new user on multisite [[#2443](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/pull/2443)].
* Disables automatic colorization when `--format=table` [[#2458](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/pull/2458)].
* Uses core's version check API for finding updates, which gives us exact URLs to download offers [[#2469](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/pull/2469)].
* Uses more robust failed download checking in `wp cli update` [[#2488](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/pull/2488)].
* Runs help early for `wp core` commands used when core isn't yet installed [[#2497](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/pull/2497)].
* Fixes formatting of GLOBAL PARAMETERS when command has subcommands [[#2516](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/pull/2516)].
* Properly handles multi-column keys in `wp search-replace` [[#2531](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/pull/2531)].
* Uses correct path to autoloader when WP-CLI is installed to a parent Composer project [[#2550](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/pull/2550)].
* Properly passes `wp plugin search` fields to `plugins_api()` request; adds `page` parameter [[#2570](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/pull/2570),[#2571](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/pull/2571)].
* Add `parent` as a potential status in `wp theme status` [[#2573](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/pull/2573)]
