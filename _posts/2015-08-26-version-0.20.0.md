### Major bug fix: cached partial upgrade files masquerading as full upgrades

Since v0.17.0 ([pull request](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/pull/1320)), WP-CLI mistakenly cached partial archives in a lossy manner. Specifically, a ZIP file for a partial upgrade would be cached with the same key as a ZIP file for a full upgrade. With the file incorrectly cached, subsequent full upgrades would use the cached partial upgrade archive.

We've [released](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/releases) v0.17.2, v0.18.1, and v0.19.3 with the bug fix. The cache key was changed as well, so prior invalid WP archives are silently ignored.

Use `wp core verify-checksums` to make sure a given WordPress install has the correct copy of each file. If it doesn't verify, use `wp core download --version=$(wp core version) --force` to re-install WordPress.

### Other changes in v0.20.0

Enhancements:

* Keep up with the bleeding edge by using `wp cli update --nightly`. When using WP-CLI nightly, the hash is now appended to the version.
* Added a simple `wp comment generate` command.
* Cache invalidation is deferred until the end when using `wp term generate`.

Bug fixes:

* `wp term generate` tries to generate unique term names on subsequent executions. Previously, it would start its index at `0`, and error for duplicate terms.
