WP-CLI v0.23.1 is a compatibility release for those who've installed WP-CLI with Composer and require a minimum-stability. See [#2664](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/issues/2664) for related conversation.

If you're using the Phar distribution of WP-CLI, you *should* `wp cli update`, but don't need to prioritize it, as the release doesn't change WP-CLI's behavior in any significant way.
