title: Version 0.20.3 released
---

WordPress 4.4 loads a few new files in `wp-settings.php` relating to oEmbed and the REST API. Because WP-CLI has as custom `wp-settings-cli.php` ([background](http://wp-cli.org/blog/how-wp-cli-loads-wordpress.html)), WP-CLI v0.20.3 is a compatibility release to load these new files. Importantly, due to the nature of these changes, WP-CLI versions prior to 0.20.3 will be incompatible with WordPress 4.4.

Stay tuned for WP-CLI v0.21.0 (to be released next week), the results of the [user survey](http://wp-cli.org/blog/user-survey-2015.html), and a special announcement.
