Just in time for your crazy load of summer projects, we have a new version of WP-CLI for you. Here's what's new.

### Manage WP-Cron

Ever confused by how WP-Cron is treating you? Wonder no more!

See all scheduled cron events:

	$ wp cron event list
	+-----------------------------+---------------------+-----------------------+------------+
	| hook                        | next_run_gmt        | next_run_relative     | recurrence |
	+-----------------------------+---------------------+-----------------------+------------+
	| wp_version_check            | 2014-07-01 04:05:59 | 3 hours 50 minutes    | 12 hours   |
	| wp_update_plugins           | 2014-07-01 04:05:59 | 3 hours 50 minutes    | 12 hours   |
	| wp_update_themes            | 2014-07-01 04:05:59 | 3 hours 50 minutes    | 12 hours   |
	| update_network_counts       | 2014-07-01 04:06:05 | 3 hours 50 minutes    | 12 hours   |
	| wp_maybe_auto_update        | 2014-07-01 07:51:00 | 7 hours 35 minutes    | 12 hours   |
	| wp_scheduled_delete         | 2014-07-01 16:06:05 | 15 hours 50 minutes   | 1 day      |
	+-----------------------------+---------------------+-----------------------+------------+

Run a particular cron event:

	$ wp cron event run wp_scheduled_delete
	Success: Successfully executed the cron event 'wp_scheduled_delete'

Inspect registered cron schedules:

	$ wp cron schedule list
	+------------+-------------+----------+
	| name       | display     | interval |
	+------------+-------------+----------+
	| hourly     | Once Hourly | 3600     |
	| twicedaily | Twice Daily | 43200    |
	| daily      | Once Daily  | 86400    |
	+------------+-------------+----------+

Take a look at `wp cron` for the full details.

### Verify core checksums

To help you ensure the sanctity of your WordPress install, `wp core verify-checksums` downloads checksums from WordPress.org and compares them to your local versions.

A successful check would look something like this:

	$ wp core verify-checksums
	Success: WordPress install verifies against checksums.

If any core files have been modified, you might see this:

	$ wp core verify-checksums
	Warning: File doesn't verify against checksum: readme.html
	Error: WordPress install doesn't verify against checksums.

### A new look

[WP-CLI.org](http://wp-cli.org) received a much-appreciated fresh coat of paint. [Share the love on Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Love%20the%20fresh%20coat%20of%20paint%2C%20%40wpcli%21%20Check%20it%20out%3A%20http%3A%2F%2Fwp-cli.org) (or report any bugs in the issue tracker).

### Other changes

Additions:

* `wp * meta delete`: supports passing a value to match against, mimicking core behavior
* `wp post generate`: the `--post_author=<post-author>` argument supports user ID, login, or email address
* `wp scaffold plugin`: Includes a sample readme.txt
* `wp (theme|plugin) install`: creates parent directories if they don't yet exist
* `wp user create`: added `--first_name=<first-name>` and `--last_name=<last-name>` parameters
* `wp user import-csv`: a `--skip-update` flag will prevent updating existing users
* More helpful messages and warnings across the board

Fixes:

* Fixed non-multisite activation of plugins with `Network: True` header
* Disabled commands no longer appear in usage docs
* Autocompletion file works properly for both bash and ZSH
* `wp core update`: fixed behavior for updating directly from a ZIP file
