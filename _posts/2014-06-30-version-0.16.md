Just in time for your crazy load of summer projects, we have a new version of WP-CLI for you. Here's what's new.

### Manage WP-Cron

### Verify core checksums

To help you ensure the sanctity of your WordPress install, `wp core verify-checksums` downloads checksums from WordPress.org and compares them to your local versions.

A successful check would look something like this:

	$ wp core verify-checksums
	Success: WordPress install verifies against checksums.

If any core files have been modified, you might see this:

	$ wp core verify-checksums
	Warning: File doesn't verify against checksum: readme.html
	Error: WordPress install doesn't verify against checksums.

@todo example of setting this up on a cron job

### Other changes

* Fixed non-multisite activation of plugins with `Network: True` header
* Disabled commands no longer appear in usage docs
* Autocompletion file works properly for both bash and ZSH
* `wp (theme|plugin) install`: creates parent directories if they don't yet exist
* `wp * meta delete`: supports passing a value to match against, mimicking core behavior
* `wp core update`: fixed behavior for updating directly from a ZIP file
* `wp post generate`: the `--post_author=<post-author>` argument supports user ID, login, or email address
* `wp scaffold plugin`: Includes a sample readme.txt
* `wp user create`: added `--first_name=<first-name>` and `--last_name=<last-name>` parameters
* `wp user import-csv`: a `--skip-update` flag will prevent updating existing users
* More helpful messages and warnings across the board
