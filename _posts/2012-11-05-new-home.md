Welcome to the new website for the WP-CLI project!

wp-cli already has a public [code repository](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli), an [issue tracker](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/issues) and a [wiki](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/wiki). The only thing that was missing was a blog for publishing release notes and other news.

Since github has built-in support for [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki), I decided to use that. The code for this website is also public: [github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli.github.com](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli.github.com)
