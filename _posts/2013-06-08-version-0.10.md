In the last two and a half months, we've added a ton of new features, fixed many bugs and improved our functional test suite.

### New installer

You can still install WP-CLI by cloning the git repo, but the preferred method is to use the installer, as described on the [front page](/).

The main reason for using the installer is to be able to leverage the optional [Boris](https://github.com/d11wtq/boris/) package, for an enhanced [wp shell](/blog/wp-shell.html) experience.

### Changelog

Commands:

* added `wp scaffold child-theme` subcommand
* added `wp media import` subcommand
* added `wp blog empty` subcommand
* added `wp post get` subcommand
* added `wp plugin list` and `wp theme list` subcommands
* added `--extra-php` flag to `wp core config` subcommand
* added `--label` option to `wp scaffold post-type` and `wp scaffold taxonomy`

* `wp core init-tests`: create the test database if necessary
* `wp db`: ignore `~/.my.cnf` file when running subcommands

### What's next?

I foresee a comeback of community commands, but in a better form.
