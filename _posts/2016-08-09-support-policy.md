title: Support policy updates

To help keep the maintenance burden manageable by volunteers, our support policies have changed: Github issues are now reserved for bug reports and enhancements of existing commands; they are no longer a venue for general support questions.

Have a question about something related to WP-CLI? Try out the [WordPress StackExchange forums](http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/wp-cli) or consider joining the `#cli` channel on the [WordPress.org Slack organization](https://make.wordpress.org/chat/).

Using WP-CLI professionally? We encourage you to purchase support from someone who contributes to WP-CLI regularly. Libre != gratis; participating responsibly in the economic ecosystem around the open source tool you depend on helps to ensure the long-term health of the project.
