To help keep the maintenance burden manageable by volunteers, our support policies have changed: Github issues are now reserved for bug reports and enhancements of existing commands; they are no longer a venue for general support questions.

Have a question about something related to WP-CLI? Try out the [WordPress StackExchange forums](http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/wp-cli) or consider joining the `#cli` channel on the [WordPress.org Slack organization](https://make.wordpress.org/chat/).

Using WP-CLI professionally? We encourage you to purchase support from a [regular WP-CLI contributor](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/graphs/contributors). Libre != gratis; the open source license grants you the freedom to use and modify, but not commitments of other people's time. Participating responsibly in the economic ecosystem around an open source tool you depend upon helps to ensure the long-term health of the project.
