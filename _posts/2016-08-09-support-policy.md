To help keep the maintenance burden manageable by volunteers, our support policies have changed: Github issues are now reserved for bug reports and enhancements of existing commands; they are no longer a venue for general support questions.

Have a question about something related to WP-CLI? You might find an answer in one of the following resources:

- [Common issues and their fixes](https://wp-cli.org/docs/common-issues/)
- [Documentation portal](https://wp-cli.org/docs/)
- [Open or closed issues on Github](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue)
- [runcommand Excerpts](https://runcommand.io/excerpts/)
- [WordPress StackExchange forums](http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/wp-cli)

If you can't find your answer at one of those links, the [WordPress StackExchange](http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/) can be used for development-related WP-CLI questions. Or, join the `#cli` channel on the [WordPress.org Slack organization](https://make.wordpress.org/chat/) to see if a community member might have an answer for you.

Using WP-CLI professionally? We encourage you to purchase support from a [regular WP-CLI contributor](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/graphs/contributors). Libre != gratis; the open source license grants you the freedom to use and modify, but not commitments of other people's time. Participating responsibly in the economic ecosystem around an open source tool you depend upon helps to ensure the long-term health of the project.
