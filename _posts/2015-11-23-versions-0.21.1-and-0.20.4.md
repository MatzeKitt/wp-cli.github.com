title: Versions 0.21.1 and 0.20.4 released
---

WordPress 4.4 loads a <del>few new files</del> <ins>even more files</ins> in `wp-settings.php`. Because WP-CLI has a custom `wp-settings-cli.php` ([background](http://wp-cli.org/blog/how-wp-cli-loads-wordpress.html)), WP-CLI v0.21.1 and v0.20.4 are compatibility releases to load these new files.

**Importantly, due to the nature of these changes, WP-CLI versions prior to 0.20.4 will be incompatible with WordPress 4.4.**

Inspect the nature of the change in [this pull request](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/pull/2218).
