title: A more RESTful WP-CLI
---

*Last updated: January 11, 2016*

WP-CLI's mission is to be, quantitatively, the *fastest* way for developers to manage WordPress. "A more RESTful WP-CLI" is a [Kickstarter-backed](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/danielbachhuber/a-more-restful-wp-cli/description) project to unlock the potential of the [WordPress REST API](http://v2.wp-api.org/) at the command line. Ultimately, the project will comprise a series of improvements to WP-CLI (and WP REST API) with this mission in mind.
