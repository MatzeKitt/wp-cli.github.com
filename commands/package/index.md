<hr />

WP-CLI packages are community-maintained projects built on WP-CLI. They can
contain WP-CLI commands, but they can also just extend WP-CLI in some way.

Installable packages are listed in the
[Package Index](http://wp-cli.org/package-index/).

Learn how to create your own command from the
[Commands Cookbook](http://wp-cli.org/docs/commands-cookbook/)
