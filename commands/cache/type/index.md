`wp cache type` - Attempts to determine which object cache is being used.

<hr />

Note that the guesses made by this function are based on the WP_Object_Cache classes
that define the 3rd party object cache extension. Changes to those classes could render
problems with this function's ability to determine which object cache is being used.
